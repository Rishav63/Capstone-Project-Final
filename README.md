**AnomaData (Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance)**

**Project Overview**

AnomaData is a machine learning project designed to predict machine breakdowns by identifying anomalies in time series data. This project aims to provide a predictive maintenance solution, helping industries reduce risks and perform maintenance before equipment failure occurs.

**Project Structure**

The project is organized into the following main components:

Data Collection
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning
Feature Engineering
Model Selection and Training
Model Validation
Hyperparameter Tuning
Model Deployment Plan

Libraries used 
To run the project, this are the following packages installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

**Instructions**

**1. Data Collection**

Ensure data.csv is in the same directory as main.py. The script will load the data from this file.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The script performs EDA to understand the data, identify patterns, and visualize relationships using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

**3. Data Cleaning**

The script handles missing values, standardizes data, and treats outliers to ensure data quality.

**4. Feature Engineering**

The script includes feature engineering steps to create new features and transform existing ones for better model performance. It ensures correct datatypes, especially for date columns.

**5. Train/Test Split**

The script applies a sampling distribution to split the data into training and testing sets, ensuring a representative split.

**6. Model Selection and Training**

The script selects and trains a suitable model. Models considered include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The best parameters are estimated during training.

**7. Model Validation**

The script evaluates the modelâ€™s performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

**8. Hyperparameter Tuning**

The script includes methods for hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search to improve model performance.

**9. Model Deployment Plan**

The script outlines a plan to deploy the model using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI, making the trained model available for production use.

**Running the Project**

Ensure all required packages are installed.

Place data.csv in the same directory as main.py.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will load the data, perform all steps from EDA to model validation, and output the evaluation metrics.
Future Work
